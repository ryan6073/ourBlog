Astro 2.0 has been released with some cool features, breaking changes, DX improvements, better error overlay and so on. AstroPaper takes advantage of those cool features, especially Content Collections API.

## Table of contents

## Features & Changes

### Type-safe Frontmatters and Redefined Blog Schema

Frontmatter of AstroPaper 2.0 markdown contents are now type-safe thanks to Astroâ€™s Content Collections. Blog schema is defined inside the `src/content/_schemas.ts` file.

### New Home for Blog contents

All the blog posts were moved from `src/contents` to `src/content/blog` directory.

### New Fetch API

Contents are now fetched with `getCollection` function. No relative path to the content needs to be specified anymore.

```ts
// old content fetching method
- const postImportResult = import.meta.glob<MarkdownInstance<Frontmatter>>(
  "../contents/**/**/*.md",);

// new content fetching method
+ const postImportResult = await getCollection("blog");
```

### Renamed Frontmatter Properties

The following frontmatter properties are renamed.

| Old Names | New Names   |
| --------- | ----------- |
| datetime  | pubDatetime |
| slug      | postSlug    |

### Default Tag for blog post

If a blog post doesn't have any tag (in other words, frontmatter property `tags` is not specified), the default tag `others` will be used for that blog post. But you can set the default tag in the `/src/content/_schemas.ts` file.

```ts
// src/contents/_schemas.ts
export const blogSchema = z.object({
  // ---
  // replace "others" with whatever you want
  tags: z.array(z.string()).default(["others"]),
  ogImage: z.string().optional(),
  description: z.string(),
});
```

### Updated Docs & README

All the [#docs](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/tags/docs/) blog posts and [README](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper#readme) are updated for this AstroPaper v2.

## Bug Fixes

- fix broken tags in the Blog Post page
- in a tag page, the last part of the breadcrumb is now updated to lower-case for consistency
- exclude draft posts in a tag page
- fix 'onChange value not updating issue' after a page reload
